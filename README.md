Capsule Warz is a game inspired by the free-for-all aspect of online multiplayer first-person shooter games. As a group, we played a lot of FPS together so we thought of making something that we can play together. Based on other subjects that we have already taken, shooter games are the most common to make and easy to create. The game is a deathmatch mode where players will spawn differently on the map. The first thing the player needs to do is to loot cube objects in order to have projectiles to shoot. The player then shoots other players in order to gain points. The reference for this project is a tutorial for youtube which we tried to make our own version of. Both UDP and TCP were used in the game server. UDP sends data every frame, it is fast but not very reliable in its accuracy. It is commonly used to send packets containing player and moving object positions to update them every frame to the clients. TCP sends data by request of the client. It is slower than UDP but provides more accurate delivery of data.
